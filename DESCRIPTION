Description: Functionality for assessing the projected lifetime excess
    absolute risk from low-LET radiation exposure. Based on models for 
    excess relative and excess absolute cancer risk for external exposure.
    Risk measures include LAR / LEAR / CER, REID / REIC, ELR, and RADS.
    Supports multiple exposure events with acute (high dose rate) or
    chronic (low dose rate) exposure.
    Supports specification of multiple cancer sites corresponding to
    exposed organs.
    Monte Carlo methods for taking into account uncertainty in risk model
    coefficient estimates, dose distribution, ERR-EAR weights for risk
    transfer, DDREF, and the latency function.
    Informed by methods developed for NCI RadRAT and BfS ProZES.
    Currently limited to these outcomes: All solid cancer, breast
    cancer, leukemia / lymphoma.
    Input data for Germany included: Baseline cancer rates, overall
    mortality rates, population size on different regional levels.
    Custom input data for other regions can be used.
