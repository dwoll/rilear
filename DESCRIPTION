Description: Functionality for assessing the excess lifetime risk from
    radiation exposure. Based on models for excess relative and excess
    absolute cancer risk for external exposure. Risk measures include
    LAR / LEAR / CER, REID / REIC, ELR, and RADS. Supports multiple
    exposure events with acute (high dose rate) or protracted (low dose
    rate) exposure. Monte Carlo methods for assessing uncertainty for
    risk model coefficient estimates, dose distribution, ERR-EAR weights
    for risk transfer, DDREF, and the latency function.
    Informed by methods developed for NCI RadRAT and BfS ProZES.
    Currently limited to these outcomes: All solid cancer, breast
    cancer, leukemia / lymphoma.
    Input data for Germany included: Baseline cancer rates, mortality
    rates, population size on different regional levels. Custom input
    data for other regions can be used.
